### 2026-02-07: Prioritize stress testing Squad on a real project

**By:** Keaton

**What:** Squad's own team should build a non-trivial feature or project using the Squad workflow to validate orchestration, parallel execution, and memory compounding under real conditions.

**Why:** Current testing is theoretical. We've defined the patterns (drop-box, parallel fan-out, casting) but haven't stressed them with genuine multi-agent work where decisions propagate, agents disagree, or orchestration fails. A real project exposes coordination bugs, reveals where the coordinator instructions are unclear, and demonstrates whether memory actually compounds. This is the only way to know if Squad works at scale.

**Next steps:** Pick a target project (non-docs, real implementation), use Squad to build it, and log what breaks.
