### 2026-02-07: Baseline testing infrastructure needed before broader adoption

**By:** Hockney

**What:** Squad currently has zero automated tests. Before we move beyond internal experimentation, we need at minimum: (1) a test framework, (2) an integration test for the happy path (run `index.js` in a temp directory, validate expected files are created), and (3) error handling for filesystem failures.

**Why:** The installer manipulates the filesystem with conditional logic (skip if exists, recursive copy, directory creation). Without tests, we have no way to know when we break something. Users will get raw stack traces instead of helpful error messages. This is acceptable for early prototyping but not for external use — even as "experimental."

**Priority:** Not blocking current iteration. But required before we ask anyone outside the core team to use this.

**Proposed approach:** Use `tap` as test framework. Start with one integration test. Add error handling incrementally as we find failure modes.
