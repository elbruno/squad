# Decision: Demo Script Format — Beat-Based Structure

**By:** McManus (DevRel)  
**Date:** 2026-02-07  
**Context:** Proposal 004 — Demo Script Overhaul

## What

The demo script (`docs/demo-script.md`) should use a **beat-based format** with three explicit sections per beat:
- 🎬 **ON SCREEN** — what the viewer sees
- 🎙️ **VOICEOVER** — exact words Brady says (recorded separately)
- 👆 **WHAT TO DO** — step-by-step physical actions during recording

## Why

Brady's feedback: the current script doesn't tell him what to *do*. During a recording session, ambiguity costs takes. The beat format eliminates improvisation — Brady can record each beat independently and stitch them in editing.

## Who needs to know

- **Keaton** — this is a demo/messaging change, needs architectural sign-off on how Squad's features are ordered and presented
- **Verbal** — the voiceover tone and agent experience claims need to match reality
- **bradygaster** — final sign-off, he's the one recording

## Status

Pending review — proposal 004 filed at `docs/proposals/004-demo-script-overhaul.md`.
