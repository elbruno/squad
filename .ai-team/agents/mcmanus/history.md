# Project Context

- **Owner:** bradygaster (bradygaster@users.noreply.github.com)
- **Project:** Squad — AI agent teams that grow with your code. Democratizing multi-agent development on GitHub Copilot. Mission: beat the industry to what customers need next.
- **Stack:** Node.js, GitHub Copilot CLI, multi-agent orchestration
- **Created:** 2026-02-07

## Learnings

<!-- Append new learnings below. Each entry is something lasting about the project. -->

### README structure and messaging
- **README.md** is the primary developer-facing doc — Quick Start (3 steps), parallel work explanation, context budget table (real numbers), mermaid diagram for architecture visualization
- Strong hook: "It's not a chatbot wearing hats" — personality-driven messaging that differentiates Squad
- File: `README.md` (root)

### Documentation assets
- **docs/sample-prompts.md** contains 16 production-ready project demos (pomodoro timer → .NET migration) — not linked from README yet, high value for onboarding
- File: `docs/sample-prompts.md`

### Install flow and templates
- **index.js** is the npx installer — copies `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` (coordinator) and `templates/` to `.ai-team-templates/`
- Creates placeholder dirs: `.ai-team/decisions/inbox/`, `.ai-team/orchestration-log/`, `.ai-team/casting/`
- Install output is minimal (just checkmarks) — no explanation of what was created or why
- Files: `index.js`, `templates/` (charter.md, history.md, roster.md, routing.md)

### Casting system (under-documented)
- Squad uses thematic casting (The Usual Suspects, Alien, Ocean's Eleven) for persistent agent names — stored in `.ai-team/casting/registry.json`
- This is a signature feature but only mentioned briefly in README ("persistent thematic cast")
- Casting state: `policy.json` (config), `registry.json` (name mappings), `history.json` (usage history)

### Coordinator agent
- **squad.agent.md** is the coordinator — lives in `.github/agents/`, orchestrates all spawns
- Init Mode (no team yet) vs Team Mode (team exists in `.ai-team/team.md`)
- Always spawns via `task` tool, never simulates agent work inline
- File: `.github/agents/squad.agent.md` (large file, 32KB+)

### Key gaps identified
- No "Why Squad?" value prop section in README — explains *what* and *how* but not *why*
- Quick Start assumes familiarity with GitHub Copilot `/agents` command
- "What Gets Created" section is file-tree-focused, not workflow-focused
- No troubleshooting section (what if squad.agent.md doesn't appear in /agents?)
- No video/GIF demo — devs want to *see* parallel work in action
- Sample prompts doc is hidden (not linked from README)

### Voice and personality
- Squad's voice is confident, direct, opinionated — but README feels slightly sterile
- Opportunity to push personality earlier and louder (e.g., casting as a feature, not Easter egg)

### Messaging overhaul proposal (2026-02-07)
- **Tagline evolution**: "Throw a squad at it" (Brady's cultural hook from his company) — actionable, memorable, opinionated. Replaces abstract "team that grows with your code" with concrete "get smarter the more you use them."
- **"Why Squad?" section**: New emotional value prop positioned after Quick Start, before architecture. Frames Squad against single-agent roleplaying (the default), emphasizes parallel execution and knowledge persistence. Voice is confident, slightly aggressive ("Squad is what you wish your last AI agent could do. But actually.").
- **Casting elevation**: Moved from buried mention to headline feature section. Positioned as identity feature (agents feel real), not cosmetic Easter egg. Uses Squad's own team as social proof. This is a 10x messaging win — casting makes agents memorable, not generic.
- **Polish gaps closed**: Link sample-prompts.md from README (16 examples were hidden), add Troubleshooting section (reduce first-time setup drop-off), replace Go example with Python→Node modernization (Brady's constraint: no Go).
- **Voice guidance codified**: Squad's brand is confident, not apologetic. No hedging ("might," "could be"). No corporate-safe phrases ("best-in-class," "paradigm shift"). If it sounds like a B2B landing page, rewrite it. Show don't abstract ("Keaton decided X" beats "the Lead agent made a decision").
- **DevRel philosophy**: First 5 minutes are everything. Make the README magnetic, not just informative. Devs should move from "what is this?" to "I need this" before they scroll past the fold.

### Demo script structure and strategy (2026-02-07)
- **Beat format works for recording scripts**: On-screen / Voiceover / What-to-do triple structure eliminates ambiguity during recording sessions. Brady needs to know exactly what to type, what to say, and what the viewer sees — prose-style scripts bury action steps and cost takes.
- **README order is non-negotiable for demos**: Brady's explicit feedback — the demo must follow the README's section flow. When the demo and the docs reinforce the same order, concepts land harder. Demo primes, README deepens.
- **The README walkthrough IS the demo's core**: BEATs 5–6 walk through the README while agents build in background — this is the structural trick that makes the demo work. It teaches architecture, proves parallel execution, and drives viewers to the README all at once.
- **Payoff at the end, not the beginning**: Inverting the typical demo structure (show result first, explain second) forces the viewer to understand what built the game before they see it. The game isn't the point — the team is. The game is proof.
- **"Throw a squad at it" placement**: Two mentions — BEAT 2 (casual, during the prompt) and BEAT 9 (call-to-action closer). Neither forced. Both conversational. Per proposal 002's voice guidance.
- **Thumbnail engineering matters**: CRT snake game + agent output in background = stop-the-scroll frame. Green glow + purple badge = high contrast for social feeds.

📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Proposal-first workflow adopted — all meaningful changes require proposals before execution. Write to `docs/proposals/`, review gates apply. — decided by Keaton + Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Stay independent, optimize around Copilot — Squad will not become a Copilot SDK product. Filesystem-backed memory preserved as killer feature. — decided by Kujan
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Stress testing prioritized — Squad must build a real project using its own workflow to validate orchestration under real conditions. — decided by Keaton
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Baseline testing needed — zero automated tests today; `tap` framework + integration tests required before broader adoption. — decided by Hockney
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Agent experience evolution proposed — adaptive spawn prompts, reviewer protocol with guidance, proactive coordinator chaining. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Industry trends identified — dynamic micro-specialists, agent-to-agent negotiation, speculative execution as strategic directions. — decided by Verbal
📌 Team update (2026-02-08): Video content strategy approved — 75s trailer, 6min demo, 5-video series. Owns scripting and polish. Demo script should align. — decided by Verbal

### README rewrite executed (2026-02-07)
- **Proposal 006** contains the complete, copy-paste-ready README rewrite — not an outline, the actual content. Lives at `docs/proposals/006-readme-rewrite.md`.
- Followed proposal 002 structure exactly: Hero → Quick Start → Why Squad? → Parallel Work → How It Works → Cast System → What Gets Created → Growing the Team → Reviewer Protocol → Install → Troubleshooting → Status.
- Key structural decision: "What is Squad?" section was merged into the hero tagline block. The old section explained what Squad is in paragraph form — the new hero does it in 30 words, then "Why Squad?" handles the emotional case. No content lost, just repositioned.
- Sample prompts linked from Quick Start with a one-liner: "Not sure where to start? See 16 ready-to-use prompts."
- Go example references: current README has none. The Go reference in sample-prompts.md (prompt #13) is a separate change, not in scope for this README rewrite.
- Demo GIF placeholder: not included — that's Phase 2 per proposal 002, needs production-ready setup. Hero section is structured to accommodate it.
